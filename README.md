# Ascir's Curses
Adds some curse enchantments to Minecraft.


<details>
<summary>All new curses</summary>

## Curse of Hallucinations
Supported items: **Helmets**.<br>
Maximum level: **1**.

Makes you hear things.

## Curse of Tripping
Supported items: **Boots**.<br>
Maximum level: **1**.

Makes you fall off edges when sneaking. I recommend you don't go end-busting with those.

## Curse of Vexing
Supported items: All **equippables**, including elytra, and all **weapons**, including axes and tridents.<br>
Maximum level: **3**.

When hitting something using a weapon enchanted with this curse, or when being hit while wearing equipment that has this curse on it, there's a small chance a vex might spawn. This chance increases with the level of the enchantment, and is applied separately for each piece of equipment, meaning it increases when more than one piece of equipment has the curse on it.

## Curse of Side Stitches
Supported items: **Helmets**.<br>
Maximum level: **1**.

You continuously take damage while sprinting. The damage is applied once for each armor piece with the curse.
